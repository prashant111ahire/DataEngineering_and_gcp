DLP- Data Loss Prevention

There are multiple types of de-identification techniques shown in below link https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference

Redaction: Deletes all or part of a detected sensitive value.
Replacement: Replaces a detected sensitive value with a specified surrogate value.
Masking: Replaces a number of characters of a sensitive value with a specified surrogate character, such as a hash (#) or asterisk (*).
Crypto-based tokenization: Encrypts the original sensitive data value using a cryptographic key. Sensitive Data Protection supports several types of tokenization, including transformations that can be reversed, or "re-identified."
This is divided in three sub-part i. Cryptographic hashing https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference#crypto-hashing ii. Format preserving encryption https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference#fpe iii. Deterministic encryption https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/transformations-reference#de

Bucketing: "Generalizes" a sensitive value by replacing it with a range of values. (For example, replacing a specific age with an age range, or temperatures with ranges corresponding to "Hot," "Medium," and "Cold.")
Date shifting: Shifts sensitive date values by a random amount of time.
Time extraction: Extracts or preserves specified portions of date and time values.
